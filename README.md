![LibraryDBMS](library.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Library Management System developed using T-SQL and SQL Server. It enables efficient management of book loans, publishers, branches, borrowers, copies, and authors. The system is designed to be scalable and organized.

## Features

- **Database Management**: Utilizes T-SQL statements to create and manage a relational database that stores information about books, borrowers, loans, and more.

- **Table Structure**: Defines well-structured tables such as `tbl_publisher`, `tbl_book`, `tbl_library_branch`, `tbl_borrower`, `tbl_book_loans`, `tbl_book_copies`, and `tbl_book_authors` to organize and link different aspects of the library.

- **Stored Procedures**: Implements stored procedures for common library management tasks, including checking book copies, retrieving borrower information, and managing loans.

## Getting Started

To run the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your SQL Server environment.
3. Execute the provided T-SQL scripts to create the necessary database and tables.
4. Explore the tailored stored procedures for seamless library operations.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can interact with the library management system using SQL queries or by utilizing the provided stored procedures. The system is designed to efficiently handle tasks such as checking book copies, managing loans, and retrieving information about borrowers and books.
